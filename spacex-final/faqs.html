        <h1>SpaceX Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

        <h2>Could SpaceX send a Dragon to the Moon?</h2>
        <p>The Dragon could easily be sent to lunar orbit, but would not be able to land. The Falcon Heavy can throw
            about 16,000 kilograms (when configured to be expendable) on a trans-lunar injection orbit, so it can send a
            Dragon 2 capsule to the moon with quite a lot of margin. However, in order to land on a surface you need to
            slow down from orbital velocity, which requires you to change your velocity by a certain amount (which is
            called your ∆V, literally "change in velocity"). Dragon 2 carries only a small amount of propellant and can
            only deliver a small amount of ∆V because of that. The exact amount is less than 500m/s, which doesn't come
            close to the ~1870 m/s needed to land on the moon. It may be possible to do it with two FH launches but that
            would require additional technology development.
        <h2>What is Red Dragon?</h2>
        <p>Red Dragon is a proposed NASA/SETI Institute mission to send a modified Dragon capsule atop a Falcon Heavy to
            the Martian surface. The mission would be an unmanned scientific lander, and the heaviest object ever to be
            placed on Mars - it alone could carry an additional 2 metric tons of cargo and equipment down to the
            surface. There have been no official announcements about the mission from SpaceX as the mission design
            architecture is not managed by them, and there is currently no indication that the project will be funded.
        </p>

        <h2>Will the Dragon be used for a manned mission to Mars?</h2>
        <p>No. Dragon is too cramped, and would need significant improvements in the life support system to last
            throughout the long journey. Elon Musk himself has stated that Dragon 2 can support seven astronauts for
            "several days".</p>

        <h2>Why does the dragon "berth" to the ISS instead of dock?</h2>
        <p>The current version of Dragon physically cannot dock, and can only berth. This is because it has a Common
            Berthing Mechanism (CBM) port, and not a NASA Docking System (NDS) port. The advantage of the CBM is that
            it's 50 inch (1270 mm) in diameter, whereas the NDS is only a 800 mm (31.5 inches) wide. The disadvantage of
            berthing is that it's a tedious process whereby astronauts carefully maneuver the capsule into place using
            Canadarm, and then physically bolt the CBM ports together. To unberth, the reverse must occur. Docking by
            contrast is autonomous, and much faster in both directions.</p>

        <h2>Can Dragon 1 be used to evacuate the International Space Station?</h2>
        <p>The Dragon 1 would make a very poor lifeboat for the ISS. The CRS Dragon does not dock, instead it "berths"
            to the ISS - this is not automated/machine controlled. Berthing is a tedious process whereby astronauts
            carefully maneuver the capsule into place using Canadarm, and then physically bolt the CBM ports together.
            To unberth, the reverse must occur. It is a very slow process, far too slow for a quick escape. There are
            two Soyuzes attached to Station that are always there and ready to at a moment's notice, so it is difficult
            to imagine a scenario where you'd have to use Dragon as an escape pod... In addition, on top of providing a
            slow evacuation, the Dragon is only there a month at a time, once every ~6 months or so, has no seats, and
            is likely to be (at least partially) filled with cargo.</p>

        <h2>Can Dragon or Dragon 2 reboost the International Space Station?</h2>
        <p>In all likelihood, no. There are lots of reasons why this would not work: Dragon does not carry enough fuel
            to reboost the station, the SuperDraco engines are far too powerful, the docking ports Dragon use are
            incapable of handling the force, the Dragon would not be firing through the station's center of mass, and
            the Dragon does not have the necessary connections to provide station Guidance, Navigation, & Control.
            Current solutions to reboosting work perfectly fine. Using Dragon would be too complicated and requires too
            much effort, whereas current solutions of reboosting the ISS are perfectly capable of doing so without
            modification.</p>

        <h2>How much Delta V does the Dragon 2 have?</h2>
        <p>According to Hans Koenigsmann at the Dragon Pad Abort press conference, the Dragon 2 weighs 21000 lbs (9525
            kg), 3500 lbs (1588 kg) of which is propellant. Assuming the SuperDracos have a specific impulse of 235 s,
            that means the total delta-v of the Dragon 2 is 420 m/s.</p>

        <h2>What would happen if one of Dragon 2's SuperDraco thrusters were to fail during landing?</h2>
        <p>Dragon 2 can lose up to two of its eight SuperDraco thrusters without any problems. The engines will be
            test-fired at a certain height to check everything as it descends towards landing. If there is a problem,
            parachutes will be deployed, and the craft will splash down in the Atlantic Ocean. There is no chance of a
            parachute landing on land in this case because the thrusters are required to actively control the vehicle to
            make sure it descends over land.</p>

        <h2>Will SuperDraco replace Draco?</h2>
        <p>No they won't, as they are designed for entirely different applications. Draco engines have a thrust of 400 N
            and are used for in-orbit maneuvering, orbit adjustments, fine guidance, orientation, and deorbiting.
            SuperDraco engines put out 73,000 N of thrust, that makes them 182.5 times more powerful. Even though they
            can throttle down to 20% (making them merely 36.5 times as powerful as a Draco), to maintain a steady
            attitude, you'd likely have to fire at least another engine on the opposite side simultaneously.</p>

        <h2>What is PICA-X? Does PICA-X ablate?</h2>
        <p>PICA stands for 'Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator', and yes, it does. It was the material used to coat the
            Stardust capsule that returned to Earth from interplanetary velocities in 2006 and was patented by NASA in
            the 1990s for use on the mission as no other heat shield material would be able to withstand the extreme
            heat and speeds that the mission heat shield would be required to handle (70% faster than the Space Shuttle,
            faster than Apollo). Ablative heat shields work by allowing small amounts of the heat shield material to
            evaporate in the extreme heat of reentry, which counter-intuitively protects the heat shield structure and
            capsule by directing the heat into the evaporated material, rather than the heat shield proper. SpaceX
            improved on this heat shield design by producing PICA-X, which is both easier and cheaper to manufacture and
            also ablates less significantly, allowing for more reuse. PICA-X versions 1 & 2 have been used on Dragon CRS
            missions to the ISS. Dragon 2 employs PICA-X version 3, which ablates even less. Because of the PICA
            heritage, SpaceX claims a capsule equipped with PICA-X can be reused from Lunar or Martian velocities
            "dozens of times" before requiring replacement.</p>

        <h2>Could Dragon 2 service the Hubble Space Telescope?</h2>
        <p>Technically, yes. But economically, it isn't feasible. The problem of the absence of an airlock can be solved
            by simply venting the entire cabin. That's how it was done in Gemini and Apollo. But in reality, it's not
            practical. It would be cheaper to build and launch a new Hubble than to design and build the needed extra
            hardware to now service it. As a bonus, you'd get a lot better telescope as Hubble hardware is fairly
            ancient by modern standards.</p>

        <h2>Why does Dragon's trunk stay attached during an abort scenario?</h2>
        <h2>Can Dragon land on land?</h2>
        <p>Dragon is designed to perform splashdown landings in water. It has a heat shield and parachutes that allow it
            to safely descend through the Earth's atmosphere and land in an ocean or other large bodies of water. This
            method of landing provides a safer and more controlled landing compared to landing on land, as it reduces
            the risk of impact forces and allows for easier recovery and retrieval of the spacecraft and crew. Landing
            on land would require additional landing systems and infrastructure, which are not currently incorporated
            into the Dragon spacecraft.</p>

        <h2>What is the purpose of the Dragon trunk?</h2>
        <p>The Dragon trunk serves multiple purposes. It provides additional space for cargo, experiments, and equipment
            that need to be exposed to the space environment. The trunk also houses the spacecraft's solar panels, which
            generate power for the Dragon during its missions in space. Additionally, the trunk acts as a structural
            component of the spacecraft, providing support and stability during launch, reentry, and landing. It is
            designed to be jettisoned before reentry, allowing the Dragon capsule to safely descend and splashdown in
            the ocean or other designated landing zones.</p>

        <h2>What are the different versions of Dragon?</h2>
        <p>There are two main versions of the Dragon spacecraft: Dragon 1 and Dragon 2. Dragon 1, also known as Cargo
            Dragon or Dragon CRS, is the first version of the Dragon spacecraft and is used for cargo resupply missions
            to the International Space Station (ISS). It is capable of carrying pressurized and unpressurized cargo to
            and from the ISS and is designed for multiple missions.</p>
        <p>Dragon 2, also known as Crew Dragon, is an upgraded version of the spacecraft designed to transport
            astronauts. It is equipped with enhanced safety features, improved crew accommodations, and the ability to
            perform autonomous rendezvous and docking with the ISS. Dragon 2 is intended for crewed missions and
            represents SpaceX's effort to restore crewed spaceflight capabilities to the United States.</p>

        <h2>How does the Dragon capsule return to Earth?</h2>
        <p>When returning to Earth, the Dragon capsule undergoes a series of reentry procedures to ensure a safe
            descent. First, the capsule initiates a deorbit burn, which slows it down and changes its trajectory to
            reenter the Earth's atmosphere. As the capsule enters the atmosphere, it experiences extreme heat generated
            by air compression, which is absorbed by the heat shield on its base.</p>
        <p>Once through the intense heat, the Dragon deploys its parachutes to slow its descent further. It uses a
            series of drogue and main parachutes to gradually reduce its speed and lower itself towards a splashdown in
            the ocean or other designated landing sites. The final phase involves the deployment of the Dragon's water
            landing legs and the capsule's flotation devices to ensure the spacecraft remains buoyant after touchdown.
