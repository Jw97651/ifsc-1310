      <h2>Old Reliable</h2>
      <!--h2 is used as my sub heading-->
      <p>Gordo's historic flight took place on <b>December 13, 1958</b> when he took off from Cape Canaveral for a 15
        minute flight into space. Even though he was weightless for over 8 minutes the on-board instruments indicated
        that Gordo enjoyed his journey into space. Scientists monitoring the flight were pleased to note that the only
        slight side effect Gordo suffered from the entry into space was a modest slowing of his pulse.</p>
      <!--p is the content I am putting in this website.-->
      <h3>The Mission</h3>
      <p>The rocket carrying <b>Gordo</b> into space would take off from the Atlantic Missile Range at Cape Canaveral,
        travel further than any monkey had ever travelled before - over 1,500 miles - and reach a height of 310 miles
        (500 km) before returning to Earth and landing in the South Atlantic, 1,302 nautical miles south of Cape
        Canaveral.

        monkey's work. <cite> Deke Slayton, Mercury Seven Astronaut.</cite></blockquote>

      <h4>The jupiter AM-13</h4>
      <p>he Jupiter IRBM <em>(Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile)</em> was originally developed by the US Army as a
        long-range successor to its PGM-11 Redstone missile, but was eventually taken over and deployed by the USAF for
        political reasons. It was also the only one of the United States' early stategic ballistic missiles with some
        mobility.</p>

      <h5>The Journey</h5>
      <p>Gordo wore a specially customised space suit custom made for a monkey about one foot tall. The space suit was
        fitted with instruments, including temperature meters and microphones which recorded his historic suborbital
        journey, considered one of the outstanding achievements of space research.</p>
